## ☕ Real-Life Example: Making Coffee

To make a good cup of coffee, we follow a specific sequence:

1. Add boiling milk
2. Add coffee decoction
3. Stir it well
4. Enjoy the coffee

If any of these steps are out of order, you won’t get the desired result — this shows how important the correct sequence is. Algorithms work the same way!

## 🌍 Algorithms in the Real World

- 🧬 The **Human Genome Project** used algorithms to identify gene pairs efficiently.
- 🔍 **Google** uses complex algorithms to deliver the most relevant search results.
- 🛵 **Food delivery apps** use shortest-path algorithms to find the fastest delivery route.

Algorithms are everywhere — in daily life, science, and technology.
